# Online Newspaper Delivery Management System

## 📌 Introduction
Newspapers were once the lifeline of the nation and hailed as the fourth estate due to their power in shaping public opinion and bringing about change. Traditionally, newspaper delivery has been a manual process involving multiple intermediaries such as printing press depots, agents, vendors, and delivery workers.

The **Online Newspaper Delivery Management System** aims to replace the traditional manual process with a digital approach, enabling users to subscribe to and read newspapers online, manage their subscriptions, and make payments seamlessly.

This system allows customers to:
- Register and log in.
- View and subscribe to their favorite newspapers.
- Pay monthly subscriptions online.
- Provide feedback on the service.
